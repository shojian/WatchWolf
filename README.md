WatchWolf
=========
This project is a support project for ToDoLister. The only purpose for this project is to automate deployment from dev machine to server through FTP connection. Probably the second purpose is to get comfortable with Node.js.

Update: Node.js on Mac OS has problems with watching files. fs.watch() works somehow, but is unable to tell which file it's watching. fs.watchFile() doesn't work any better. I may try to use Java with Watch Service API.
